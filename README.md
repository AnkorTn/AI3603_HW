### Homework 1

In this homework, you will develop a path planning framework for a service robot in the unknown environment using A* algorithm. Suppose an autonomous robot DR20 exploring in an unknown scene. The global map is unavailable for the robot at the beginning of exploration, but a laser scanner mounted on robotâ€™s body is utilized to scan the obstacles around the robot. The robot can gradually build the map as it explores, until it reaches the goal.

### Homework 2

There are 2 tasks in this homework. First: In this assignment, you will implement Reinforcement Learning agents to find a safe path to the goal in a grid-shaped maze. The agent will learn by trail and error from interactions with the environment and finally acquire a policy to get as high as possible scores in the game. Second: In this part, you are asked to implement intelligent agents to play the Sokoban game utilizing Sarsa, Qlearning, and dyna-Q algorithms. You will have a deeper understanding on the model-based RL algorithms and the explore-exploit dilemma.
